Display Recommendations
### Applications
* Platforms like online retail stores can use style images uploaded by users to recommend clothing and accessories that match the user's preferred style. This personalized approach enhances user engagement and satisfaction by providing recommendations that closely align with individual tastes.
* Applications that help users plan outfits or manage their wardrobe can utilize style images to suggest new pieces that complement existing items. Users can upload photos of their favorite outfits, and the system can recommend new clothing items or accessories that fit the same style or color scheme.
* Fashion brands and retailers can analyze style images uploaded by users to identify emerging trends and consumer preferences. By understanding what styles and combinations users prefer, brands can adjust their inventory, marketing strategies, and product designs to better meet market demands.
